Letris, a small JavaScript Tetris clone, 2024 by Lee Blum

Tetris was created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov

Not much to explain, everything is on screen.

There are 5 levels, each with 10 rows to beat. You can do it!

To run it locally, just double click index.html

I took some 4 hours to write this small game from scratch.
